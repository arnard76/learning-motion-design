# Transitions
*from one state to another (with no stops in between)*

## CSS Transitions
```css
.btn {
    transition: all 400ms .4s;
    /* convenient but not performant */
    /* try individual transitions for each property */
}

.btn:hover {
    background-color: lightgray;
    color: #6E32EF;
}
```
