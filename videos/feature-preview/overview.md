## What?
I am going to make a "preview" of a feature. The preview of the feature and the feature are both on the website. 

### What the preview looks like?
The preview looks like a video of the feature being used.
If the user clicks on the preview then it becomes the actually feature (with dummy data) and the user can try out the feature.

## Why?
so the user can both understand the feature as well as gets hands-on without needing to make an account.

acts as marketing/informing the visitor what the website can do.

## How?

- video can come from the cypress e2e test? or just a video snip ðŸ˜€
- interactive preview of feature can come from the actual components with dummy data? or embed the actual website looool (for features that don't require login)
