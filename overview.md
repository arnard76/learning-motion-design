## What?
stuff that moves by itself or when you interact with it.

two main types:
1. informative motion 
   - e.g. to show users how to interact i.e. functional affordance
   - e.g. animate/transition information onto page so user immediately focuses on it
2. aesthetic motion
   - adding personality or character to website (makes it more unique)
   - e.g. loading screens

## Why?

Because it enhances the UX as the information/interactions are delivered
in an engaging way.

## How?

by adding:
- [videos](./videos/overview.md)
- [transitions](./transitions/overview.md) - from one state to another
- animations - more complex than transitions
